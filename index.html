            <h1>Hi "Student,"</h1>
            <p>We wanted to welcome you to “College Name” where we work hard to create a safe and healthy
            environment for all of its members. We have teamed up with Behavioral Science Technologies
            (BST) who has developed a Sexual Violence Prevention and Alcohol Education program. The
            program unfolds over the course of 8 episodes, mini-dramas supplemented with advice from
            knowledge leaders and peers and interactive content. The program has been funded by both
            Centers of Disease Control and National Institutes of Health and tested with two large-scale
            studies. Here is a 2-minute video to help you understand what you will be experiencing.
            </p>
            <p>Completion of RealConsent® is required for all students of “Name of College.”
            Please complete the program by “Date (day of week and date).
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for your participation and wish you a wonderful start of your college experience.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>“College”</p>
